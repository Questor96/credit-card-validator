INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:
From root directory, `npm run install-and-build-all` to install all dependencies and create build files

TO USE:
1) In terminal, from backend directory, `npm run start` to create backend server instance
2) In separate terminal, from frontend directory, `npm run start` to create frontend and open page
(these could be bundled into single process start using webpack, intentionally kept separate for this project)
